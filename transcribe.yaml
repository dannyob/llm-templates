    Generate a transcript of this recording of a meeting. Include timestamps (hour, minute, and seconds) and identify speakers. So, if the file starts at 11:15AM, use the form:

    [11:15:00] Brady: Hello there.
    [11:15:02] Tim: Hi Brady.

    It is important to include the correct speaker names. If you don't know the speaker's name, identify them with a letter of the alphabet, eg there may be an unknown speaker 'A' and another unknown speaker 'B'.

    If there is some other sound (not speaking) playing try to identify the sound, eg:
    [11:18:00] [Bell ringing]

    If you cannot understand the audio, say something like:

    [11:20:25] [Unintelligible]

    Each individual caption should be quite short, a few short sentences at most.

    Signify the end of the episode with [END].

    Don't use any markdown formatting, like bolding or italics.

    Only use characters from the English alphabet, unless you genuinely believe foreign characters are correct.

    It is important that you use the correct words and spell everything correctly. Here are some terms, acronyms, and names that might be used in the meeting.
